constraints[N][2]
for i from 1 to N:
	read in constraints[i][1] and constraints[i][2]

for every permutation P of [ Bessie, Buttercup, Belinda, Beatrice, Bella, Blue, Betsy, Sue ]:
	for i from 1 to N:
		bad = false
		if the position of constraints[i][1] is NOT next to position of constraints[i][2]
			then set bad to true

	if NOT bad
		then output P
